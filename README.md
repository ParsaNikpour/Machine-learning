# Optimization
In this project I build a machine learning model in Jupyter Lab. I used diabetes data from scikit-learn datasets. This program has mutliple sections. In the first one I code it from scratch. I used linear regression and gradient descent to find the optimal parameters, w and b.

First I import the packages and load the data and also, represent it in pandas dataframe.
